# My submission to the Hashnode Hackathon AWS Amplify Hackathon on Hashnode 🥳

## Aybow Fitness: https://aybow-fitness.vercel.app/

Aybow Fitness is a web-application where you can easily create your own workout routines, or browse routines created by other users!

The inspiration behind Aybow is the frustration and clunkiness I find day-to-day when using tools like Google Sheets to track my progress in the gym.

Please see my blog post hosted on Hashnode describing the process of building Aybow below!
